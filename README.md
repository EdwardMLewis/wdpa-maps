# wdpa-maps
A repo for automatically creating WDPA maps each month

Ideas for this work:
1. fully automated map making in the team - when the wdpa is updated onto PP.net/[other location] then a whole load of precooked maps are made and put in one place.

2. This will include all the online maps, e.g. wfs/wms

3. This will also include all the vector tiles etc used on PP.live

4.
